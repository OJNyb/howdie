The additional material for Empty the Cave will now be presented every few weeks. They will first appear on my Locals channel (link below) and around 2-3 weeks later the material will appear here on this website. The first section of material is on the life of Suzanne Segal and the unique part of her story that I only came across in a blog post made in 2017. The additional material is free to access on locals and you can discuss the subject with the community of members there who have many interesting ideas to share on these subjects
