Most people will say something feels terribly wrong… with reality, the world, life. Why is that? Because something is wrong. This whole experience called “life on Earth” is a falsified lie.

Standard spirituality, religion and the New Age tell us that we live in a wonderful world, made by a creator who loves us, and who is always waiting for our prayers. Yet some groups, such as the Gnostics and Cathars, believed that we live in a virtual reality simulation, fashioned by an evil creator, with the purpose of consuming our energy and keeping our soul trapped. Plato created the allegory of the Cave to present that we live in a non- real reality, and in fact, are prisoners in it.

Exit the Cave takes a candid exploration into the reincarnation trap, by unpacking a plethora of diverse information from ancient texts and near death experiences, to movies such as Dark City and Westworld in an attempt to deconstruct and understand Plato’s Cave allegory. Most significant of it all, is how important it is to be prepared at the moment of one’s death – our only true “guaranteed experience.” What awaits us on the other side of turning our back on constant incarnations in a pit of suffering? Perhaps it is what our soul has been dreaming of for eons… going Home.
